# Group 04 PWA
Used the following tutorial and base code
### [How to build a PWA from scratch with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript](https://www.ibrahima-ndaw.com/blog/how-to-build-pwa-with-javascript/)


# PWA
This repository includes a PWA where you can see different coffees. The idea is that in the future you can upload your own.
It uses Cache API and IndexedDB API

## Usage
The app is uploaded in the following [page](https://iic3585-2024.github.io/pwa-group-04/#). Right now you can't test it locally.

The initial elements are loaded in a cache and there is a IndexedDB API where the coffees you clicked are saved.
